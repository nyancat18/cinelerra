Requires libzmpeg3 from heroinewarrior.com
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a Quicktime front end for UNIX in a library.



Building:
Quicktime for Linux requires a built copy of of libzmpeg3 in a directory next to itself.
This is used for the mp3 interface.

Your directory structure should thus be:
/my_directory
/my_directory/libzmpeg3-*.*.*
/my_directory/quicktime4linux-*.*.*


type "make" in the libzmpeg3 directory.
type "make" in the quicktime directory.
type "make util" to get quicktime to build some utilities.


The makefiles automatically configure themselves.  The library is in
i686/libquicktime.a. You should manually set the CFLAGS environment
variable with the optimum optimization parameters for your i686
derivative.
